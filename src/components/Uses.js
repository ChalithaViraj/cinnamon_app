                            <b>Oil</b>
                            <p>The cinnamon leaf oil obtains through steam distillation on collected leaf and twigs that remains 
                            on the cultivation after harvesting. Cinnamomum verum leaf oil contains higher amount of eugenol (68 – 87%) and 
                            less amount of cinnamaldehyde (0.5 – 1%).</p>

                            <p>The leaves are obtained as a by-product of the industry. The leaf oil is cheaper
                            than bark oil and internal consumption not recommended.</p>

                            <p>The other form of essential oil, the bark oil is the result of steam distillation of 
                            cinnamon bark. This contains mostly cinnamaldehyde (63 – 75%) and eugenol (2 – 13%).</p>

                            <p>The cinnamon bark oil is one of the expensive essential oils in the market. The quality of 
                            bark oils depend on the material used to distill the oil. Quills are always recommended to 
                            obtain high quality bark oil, but it is not always used for the distillation.</p>

                            <p>Unlike the two categories of Sri Lanka cinnamon oil, only one category of essential 
                            oil exists in cinnamomum cassia. This is because Cassia oil is distilled from a mixture 
                            of many parts of the tree. So, there is only one type of cassia oil exists.</p>
